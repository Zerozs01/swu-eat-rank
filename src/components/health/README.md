## Related Health Conditions

The system can identify potential risks for:
- **Obesity** (‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏ô) - Based on low health scores and low vegetable intake
- **Diabetes** (‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ô) - Based on poor food choices and low health scores
- **Kidney Disease** (‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡πÑ‡∏ï) - Based on very low health scores
- **Heart Disease** (‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏Ñ‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß‡πÉ‡∏à) - Based on moderate to low health scores
- **Hypertension** (‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏î‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÇ‡∏•‡∏´‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏™‡∏π‡∏á) - Based on low health scores

## Usage

```tsx
import { useHealthInsights } from '../../hooks/useHealthInsights';
import { HealthInsightCard } from './HealthInsightCard';

function MyComponent() {
  const { explanation } = useHealthInsights(logs);

  return (
    <HealthInsightCard explanation={explanation} />
  );
}
```

## Integration

The health insight system is integrated into:
- `OptimizedHealthSummary.tsx` - As a new "‡∏ß‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏∞‡∏´‡πå‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Ç‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û" tab
- Health score card shows the overall status label
- Provides comprehensive health analysis beyond basic scores
